title: v0.1 released to PyPi
---

The first stable version of django-oscar has been released to PyPi.  Install
it using:

	pip install django-oscar

This is still an early version - the dashboard app is not included.  The first few
of Tangent's projects are built on this version but implement their own 
dashboards for products.
