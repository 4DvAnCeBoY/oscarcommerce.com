title: New version of PayPal extension
author: David Winterbottom

A new version (0.2) of the PayPal extension for Oscar has been released which includes support
for Payflow Pro.  Payflow Pro is a server-to-server payment option which allows a customer to 
pay with a bankcard, as opposed to Express Checkout which involves redirecting the customer
to the PayPal site and paying using their PayPal account.

The advantages of this are:

* Better user experience as the customer never leaves your site.
* Support for two-phase payment models where an authorisation request is made at checkout, with
  with settlements being triggered when goods ship.  
* Support for multiple settlements for a single authorisation.  
* Good reporting dashboard within PayPal

The Oscar extension features full support for Payflow Pro, a new dashboard section for 
examining transactions and a updated set of docs for getting started.
